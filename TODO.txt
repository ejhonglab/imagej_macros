- hotkey to close all open images and ROI manager (making sure ROI manager wouldn't have
  ROIs if opened again) (so that the 1/2 hotkeys can be used again w/o worrying, or just
  modify them to clear ROI manager [unless/if modifier?])

- add script / plot_roi.py option to go to plane that would be used as max for a given
  ROI name

- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- if i ever get an add hotkey going that auto-opens the rename dialog, also try to
  default to glomerulus of any cognate diagnostic (if not on current plane yet)

- change F2 hotkey to only load the processed TIFFs by default, and maybe other hotkeys
  (perhaps F2 w/ some modifiers?) for also loading mocorr_concat.tif + processed TIFFs?

  - maybe more importantly, another hotkey for loading raw + mocorr concat TIFFs only,
    for evaluation of mocorr quality

- why (on atlas) does shift+p seem to do what alt+p is supposed to do (in addition to
  doing something else first...)?
