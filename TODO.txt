- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- custom hotkey + plugin to allow <Delete> to work w/ ROIs in overlay, similar to
  updating/renaming stuff i have on [r]

- get .desktop file I'm actually using for ImageJ loading the environment variables i
  have in ~/.bashrc + ~/.variables correctly (or just wrap my call to my program in
  [login?] bash invocation?)
