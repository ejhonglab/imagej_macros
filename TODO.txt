- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- custom hotkey + plugin to allow <Delete> to work w/ ROIs in overlay, similar to
  updating/renaming stuff i have on [r]

- something like F1, but just for plotting trace w/in current odor period

- (especially if possible to call external programs, i.e. some of my python scripts)
  hotkey to plot full tuning curve for an ROI (in terms of a per-trial mean, with odors
  labelled). see al_analysis/plot_roi.py
