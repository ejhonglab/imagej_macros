- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- script + hotkey to load / calculate odor <-> frame associations and overlay odor info
  (via TextROIs added to overlay?) on each frame

- make another hotkey for something that switches between all windows
  (all synced windows really, but can probably just do all), and does the equivalent of
  pressing <Esc>, to clear any partially drawn current ROI
