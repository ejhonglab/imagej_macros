- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- custom hotkey + plugin to allow <Delete> to work w/ ROIs in overlay, similar to
  updating/renaming stuff i have on [r]

- remap Ctrl-S to save ROI manager ROIs

- change F2 hotkey to only load the processed TIFFs by default, and maybe other hotkeys
  (perhaps F2 w/ some modifiers?) for also loading mocorr_concat.tif + processed TIFFs?

  - maybe more importantly, another hotkey for loading raw + mocorr concat TIFFs only,
    for evaluation of mocorr quality

- why (on atlas) does shift+p seem to do what alt+p is supposed to do (in addition to
  doing something else first...)?
