- populate ROI name field w/ current diagnostic by default!

- shift+p / other hotkey for plotting all ROIs w/ same name (sorted by z)
  - similar hotkey for renaming all ROIs sharing same name (similar to how renumber
    function does it)

- try to get 'd' hotkey (delete matching ROI) to not switch slice

- hotkey for going to first diagnostic w/o a labelled glomerulus?

- hotkeys for coloring ROIs according to whether they are done or not
  (i.e. whether we checked for contamination, etc). can store that data in something
  like a json alongside RoiSet.zip, and color in ROI overlayer?

  - similarly color odor name green in that overlay, if glomerulus for diagnostic is
    already labelled?
    + hotkey to go to first non-labelled diagnostic odor

- automatically pick reasonable colormap scale (from max intensity across all odors?)
  (ideally via somehow automating Ctrl-Shift-c B&C contrast manager, or via changing the
  same settings it does)

- hotkey (K?) to kill existing plot server (to not need another terminal to run
  `pkill -f '/plot_roi'`)

- hotkey to close all open images and ROI manager (making sure ROI manager wouldn't have
  ROIs if opened again) (so that the 1/2 hotkeys can be used again w/o worrying, or just
  modify them to clear ROI manager [unless/if modifier?])

- add script / plot_roi.py option to go to plane that would be used as max for a given
  ROI name

- add a script + hotkey to sort ROIs by (depth, name) (not sure in which sort order)

- if i ever get an add hotkey going that auto-opens the rename dialog, also try to
  default to glomerulus of any cognate diagnostic (if not on current plane yet)

- change F2 hotkey to only load the processed TIFFs by default, and maybe other hotkeys
  (perhaps F2 w/ some modifiers?) for also loading mocorr_concat.tif + processed TIFFs?

  - maybe more importantly, another hotkey for loading raw + mocorr concat TIFFs only,
    for evaluation of mocorr quality

- why (on atlas) does shift+p seem to do what alt+p is supposed to do (in addition to
  doing something else first...)?

- "c" hotkey to compare all ROIs w/ same name (put all in one plot, as if adding all via
  alt+p). (exclude '+'/'?' characters for this purpose)

- hotkey+system for marking volumetric ROIs as done scrutinizing (or varying degrees of
  done, perhaps as in the various checkboxes for this in the gsheet?)?
